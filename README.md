## Numpy.Random

This repository is an investigaton into the numpy.random package in Python. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that outlines the following:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package
In this section I discuss the numpy package overall and then specifically the numpy.random package

2. Explain the use of the "Simple Randmon data" and "Permutations" functions.
Here I talk about Simple Random Data and Permutations. I use the Rand and Randit functions to talk about and explain Simple Random Data.
As there are only two Permutations Fuctions both of these are described and discussed.

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five of the "Distributions" functions.
There 5 distributions functions that I discuss are:
-Uniform Distribution
-Bionomial Distribution 
-Poisson Distribution
-Normal Distribution
-Geometric Distribution

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
In this section I explain about seeds and how and why they are set in generating pseudorandom numbers.

I include here aslo a link that explains how to run a Jupyter Notebook.
