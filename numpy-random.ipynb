    "# 1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The numPy.random package is a sub package of the NumPy package in Python. The numPy.random package is also known as Random Sampling. \n",
    "NumPy is really important package due to the fact that a lot of other packages depend on it. Interacting with numPy directly is not that commmon, it is used most via sub packages. One would typically interact with numPy objects through other packages such as Pandas or SciPy or another scientific package. \n",
    "The numPy.random package specifically is about generating random numbers. There are multiple ways to generate pseudorandom numbers with the numPy.random package.\n",
    "This notebook will detail what the over numPy package is about and then delve deeper into the numpy.random package specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of documentation about the numPy package available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numPy documentation itself says that \"NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more\". \n",
    "At the heart of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance. There are several important differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original.\n",
    "The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory. The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.\n",
    "NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences.\n",
    "A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are using NumPy arrays; though these typically support Python-sequence input, they convert such input to NumPy arrays prior to processing, and they often output NumPy arrays. In other words, in order to efficiently use much (perhaps even most) of today’s scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to use Python’s built-in sequence types is insufficient - one also needs to know how to use NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically the above detailed explanation from the Numpy documentation is saying that Numpy is really good at generating numbers and dealing with numbers in long lists in python. For example if you were seeking to do some work with matrices within python one could code them up but would probably run into errors when runnning the code and would be inefficient. Numpy can mock up the data way more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is a specialist package that deals with multi dimensional arrays( which are lists within lists). Numpy likes two dimensional lists where each column and each row has the same number of elements. It can createa arrays with more than two dimensions but typically it could just be dealing with two arrays. For example numpy would not like the Iris data set as the data set has both numbers and text included in the array. Pandas can deal with this type of data more efficiently. It is very commmon when working with data to start and import a .csv file into numpy or pandas which would then use numpy in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is also very good for generating random simple data. If you were not able to collect the data but you wanted to pretend that you did to examine it or test some fuctions then the numpy package can generate random numbers that follow a certain pattern. Again we generally do not use numpy directly but the generation of random simple data would be covered by the numpy.random functions within which there are multiple sections and functions which will be discussed in more detail throughout this notebook. \n",
    "Real world examples of where numpy is used is where matrix operations are used for example in the re-sizing of photos.\n",
